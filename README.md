# River Runner

This uses USGS NHDPlus data and their NLDI API to track the path of a rain droplet from any point in the contiguous United States to its end point (usually the ocean, sometimes the Great Lakes, Canada/Mexico, or another inland water feature). It'll find the river/stream path and then animate along that path. It's big a work in progress right now.
